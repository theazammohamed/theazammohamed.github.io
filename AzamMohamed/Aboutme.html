Azam Mohamed. I'm a Student of <a href="https://zahiracollege.lk">Zahira College</a> and it is where i started to discover my hidden skills and talents.
            <br>Some of the skills which i excel in are:

            <font face="Footlight MT Light" size="5">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was even an active member in many clubs & societies at our school. For Extra-curricular activities i had mostly excelled in Football as a Goal Keeper, But I had also played Basketball, Hockey and did Scouting too.</p>
                <p>Time flew by.....<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I from very young ages looked forward to build up a career in the tech industry, Started it off by trying to become a Web Developer. So it is where i'm now developing quality Front-end websites which you witness even now, and i know this journey is not just the end as I've realised that if i want to excell and survive in the industry I have to be a learner throughout the journey and i will be it :)</p>
